Wildflower
Soft like wildflowers by rivers and streams
Thoughts washing over me like the stuff of my dreams
And I see it coming true
We'll be soft like you
We'll be soft like you

Sarah
Hey
Do you want to be
Or don't you want to be
Soft like me

Hey
Do you want to be
Or don't you want to be
Soft like me

I used to wonder why big boys don't cry
'Cause they were always taught to hold it deep inside
Hide the feelings
They bubble to the top
When it's all going off
Better put 'em up
Let 'em know you're tough

And remember
They won't take backtalk
Then you should never let that walk

"And son, if you run back to me defenseless
Then, boy, I'm a wanna beat you senseless"

And that's Daddy
Doing what he can
To make that boy a man
I have a different plan

Baby, I'll encourage you to be
Expressive not aggressive
More soft around the edges
Just like me

Sarah
Hey
Do you want to be
Or don't you want to be
Soft like me

Hey
Do you want to be
Or don't you want to be
Soft like me

Little girls are made of everything nice
We pay the price
For wearing hearts on sleeves
I still believes
We hold the key
To the better way to be
With feminine energy
I touch the universe
But what came first
Was peace to all mankind
But in this
Time and a hard life
I'm having a hard time
With growing a thick skin
'Cause I soak up all the hurt
And hold it all within
And I've been this way from day
I never got no hugs
When I fell down in the play-
Ground
Maybe it would be different now
But how a mother's love
Gave so much to us, too
Made us soft but strong
Just like you

I see it coming true
We'll be soft like you

Sarah
Hey
Do you want to be
Or don't you want to be
Soft like me

Hey
Do you want to be
Or don't you want to be
Soft like me

Wildflower
Yeah, you're a tough guy
And a hard knot
Say you wanna do it
Oh
But a big butt
Scared to get into it
'Cause when you gave your love and trust
Your heart got crushed, in a rush
Head got twisted up
Files went corrupt
Your system overload
As you went chugging down that lovely road
You could take the physical blows
But emotional lows
Left him on the ropes

Somehow she always copes with the pain
And comes back again
Like, yeah, you know me, girl
Stay ready for the world
From the red corner
Stay warmer
Born in optimistic
Hoping that his heart will open

Sarah
Hey
Do you want to be
Or don't you want to be
Soft like me

Hey
Do you want to be
Or don't you want to be
Soft like me

I said you'll never take a flight from (?)
So don't you want to be
Soft like me

I said you'll never take a flight from (?)
So don't you want to be
Soft like me
