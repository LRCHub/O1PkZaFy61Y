(As we diverge one by one)
(From the final curtain call)
(There's a trail of memories)
(That follows me closely)
(I could almost call it home)

At the end of it all
As we diverge one by one
From the final curtain call
There's a trail of memories
That follows me closely
I could almost call it home

All that was
And ever will be
Cut down in two
Forever in bloom
(Forever in bloom)

Waiting for the call
That'll take me back
As idle hands linger
For something to do

All that was
And ever will be
Cut down in two
Forever in bloom

Forever in bloom
Forever in bloom
Forever in bloom
Forever in bloom
