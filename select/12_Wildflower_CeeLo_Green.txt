Who should I be
Whether I'm good or bad
Should lead us both to be
So I pray for rain
And if I had her every day
I'd still praise her just the same
All it takes is the moonlight
And as long as the weather's fair
She reacts to the rhythm
Aroused by the evening air
The fragrance of her flesh
This is who she is
Don't apologize
You are to all but you only
Have to be beautiful to
In the beholder's eyes
Wonderful Wildflower
Open up and let me see
Sexy is in season
Share your sunshine with me
The picture is perfect
A keepsake 'cause the occasion's rare
She's poetry in motion
I'm just glad to say that I was there
To pull her out of the ground
Standing out in the crowd
Oh my how's she grown
Hold her with both my hands
Put her right on my table when I get her home
Wonderful Wildflower
Open up and let me see
Sexy is in season
Share your sunshine with me
Show those pretty colors baby
Show them off to everyone
Everybody's gotta
Live their life under the sun
Wonderful Wildflower
Open up and let me see
Sexy is in season
Share your sunshine with me
